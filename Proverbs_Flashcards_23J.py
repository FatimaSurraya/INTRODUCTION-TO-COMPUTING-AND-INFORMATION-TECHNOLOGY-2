"""
This flashcard program allows the user to ask for a word_list entry.
In response, the program randomly picks an entry from all word_list
entries. It shows the entry. After the user presses return, the
program shows the definition of that particular entry.
The user can repeatedly ask for an entry and also
has the option to quit the program instead of seeing
another entry.
